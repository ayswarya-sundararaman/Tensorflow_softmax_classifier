# TensorFlow Softmax Classifier

This project implements a **Softmax Classifier** using TensorFlow for multi-class classification. The classifier is applied to a dataset, and the goal is to predict the class of an input data point by assigning probabilities to multiple classes.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is a multi-class classification dataset (specific dataset details should be mentioned).
- **Features**: Input features of varying types (numerical, categorical).
- **Target**: Multi-class output with one correct class per instance.

## Key Techniques
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalized input data for better model performance.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Implemented a single-layer softmax classifier using TensorFlow.
   - Optimizer: **Adam** optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
   - Loss Function: **Cross-Entropy Loss**.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Trained the model for multiple epochs, tracking loss and accuracy.
   - Evaluated the classifier's performance on the test dataset.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plotted training loss and accuracy to monitor model performance over epochs.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating effective multi-class classification.
- **Loss**: The model converged well, with loss decreasing significantly after several epochs.

## Conclusion
The TensorFlow Softmax Classifier effectively handles multi-class classification tasks, with the implemented model achieving high accuracy and low loss on the dataset.
